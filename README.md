# CH32V103-HAL-RS (WIP)

## Inroduction

This project is attend to implement hal in rust on wch-ch32 microcontroller, now in a very early stage.

Now work well:

- [x] GPIO
- [x] RCC
- [x] AFIO
- [x] Delay

<!-- ## Usage

```shell
  git clone https://github.com/kznr02/CH32-rs
  cd CH32-rs
  cargo build --package ch32-app
  wlink flash target/riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf/debug/ch32-app
```

> Please connect LED on PA0, and build `ch32-app` package, flash with `wlink`, you will see the led on.
